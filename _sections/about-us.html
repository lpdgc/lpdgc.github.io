Long’s Peak Disc Golf Club was formed in 2001. Today we have over 150 members annually. Our purpose is to promote disc golf in Longmont, CO and the surrounding area.

Annual membership is $25 which includes a bag tag that can be played to increase your standings. You can purchase your club membership anytime throughout the year from any of the board members while at any of our club run events such as Wednesday tags/league – or anytime at <a href="https://www.playitagainsports.com/locations/longmont-co">Play It Again Sports</a>.
