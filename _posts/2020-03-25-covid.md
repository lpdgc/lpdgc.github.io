In light of events in the past weeks and up to today, the LPDGC is obviously cancelling all organized events and functions until further notice. Hopefully that is sooner than we're thinking, but any groups of people using the same equipment (baskets) are at a much higher risk now, and in our tight-knit community that's something that could affect all of our friends and families very quickly.

Furthermore, the club and chat page will not be used to organize meetups. Any posts as such will be deleted, we would ask that you instead use the page to help each other through this. If you need or have anything that might help our family, please use the chat page to reach out to each other.
Also, please know that this is a heavy-hearted decision but something as simple as a tag swap could change someone's life at this point. Obviously you are 100% free to "exercise at a safe distance" (if it is allowed?), but the LPDGC advises you stay home, stay healthy, and get ready for Summer League. Be safe, be good.❤️
