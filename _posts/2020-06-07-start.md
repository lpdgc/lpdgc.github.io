We have been cleared by the city to begin league play starting on Wednesday, 6/17!

There will be a lot of information coming out in the next few days but we have some necessary steps that we must adhere to in order to make this all work. In the meantime, our first order of business is eliminating check-in entirely.

We can NOT have people milling about at the practice basket before or after the round. We emphasized that we are not a group of 40, but 10 groups of 4. It is VITAL that we make that happen to keep our gathering size below state mandates. 

We are currently setting up online registration and we will be using Udisc to score rounds. ALL players need to download the app at https://udisc.com/.It is a free download for the version we will be using, but you must have the app to play as all scoring will be done digitally. Download it now, use it for a few rounds and get used to it if you haven't already.

We're really excited to get this all going again, keep tabs over the next few days as we'll have a lot more information coming at you!!!
